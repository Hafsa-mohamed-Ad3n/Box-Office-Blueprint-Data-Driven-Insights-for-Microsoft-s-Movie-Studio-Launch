## Project Overview
With the rise of streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, original content has become extremely valuable. Our company wants to join the industry by creating its own movie studio. This project explores data from IMDB and Box Office Mojo to understand what types of movies perform well at the box office. The goal is to extract patterns in genres, ratings, and other characteristics to guide the studioâ€™s production strategy.

## Business Problem
Our company wants to produce original movies but lacks experience in the industry. The leadership team needs insights into:

- Which genres make the most money?
- Do highly rated movies earn more?
- What are the common traits of successful movies?
